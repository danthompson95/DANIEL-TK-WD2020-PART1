## Documentation

This website is built purely in HTML and SCSS and follows the design brief given.
It utilises no extra tools apart from importing the text family.

### Syntax Choices (CSS)
Camel case has been used for any ID's
Hyphens have been used for any Classes

### Design Choices
Some aspects of the site utilise flexbox to avoid using any floats and generally make things easier in mobile designs.
Everything is written to fit mobile responsive specification.

### Naming Conventions
There are points where I have tried to loosely follow BEM CSS such as article-item and article-text-group.
Everything which doesn't follow this tries to match the section it is for.
